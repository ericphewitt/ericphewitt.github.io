# CoHab
Cohab is a matching web database that connects individuals who would like to purchase a home together.

## Project Overview
With rising interest rates, the evolution of the sharing economy, and the unstable future real estate market - CoHab will allow younger homebuyers the ability to meet other like-minded individuals to spread their real estate risk and costs.

__Target Users:__
I would like to target first-time homebuyers, renters, and individuals with roommates or those living at home.

### Features will include:
- a form to enter data such as:
    - location to purchase
    - timeline (1 month, 3 months, 6 months )
    - credit score estimate 
    - email
    - phone
    - address
    - down payment money 
    - prequalification or preapproval status
    - amount they can purchase together (50% each) 
- a matching method to match two people looking for a similar property 
- a tab on the site to search for properties 
- a messaging feature or blog-like posting by area to manually search for people

### User story 
As a person wanting to spread real estate risk and own property with another, I need a way to identify and screen potential co-owners.
